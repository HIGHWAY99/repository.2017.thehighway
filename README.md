-------------------------------

TheHighway's xbmc plugin repository!

-------------------------------


* Install:

You can manually install via System - Add-ons - Install from zip file... 

if you wish to manually download the zip from:

http://raw.github.com/HIGHWAY99/repository.thehighway/master/repo/repository.thehighway/repository.thehighway-0.0.6.zip



** Another means is via SuperRepo.org:

As shown @ https://superrepo.org/get-started/

Add Files source named "SuperRepo": http://srp.nu/

Then goto: System - Addons - Install from zip file - SuperRepo (the Files source you just made).

Select your type of xbmc/kodi installed such as "Helix".

Select "all".

Select "repository.superrepo.org.helix.all-latest.zip" to install SR's repository of user repositories among seemingly all other things.

Now back up to where you clicked "Install from zip file" and click "Get Add-ons".

Next click "SuperRepo  All [helix]" or simular.  Sometimes you'll have to right click this and hit force refresh a couple times or so until it populates a list.

Once it comes up with a list, click "Add-on repository", there should be a HUGE list of repositories here.

Scroll way down or up to get to the bottom and up a bit more until you find the T's, then select "TheHighway's Addons" and include Install on the next screen.

Once it's done downloading and installing, you man then go back to the "Get Add-ons" list and select TheHighway's Addons" (sometimes having to force refresh), and browse a list of addons by TheHighway for download.
